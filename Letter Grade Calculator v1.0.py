#Instructions:
#When we read code and predict its output, 
#it is called tracing code.

#For this lesson, you will come up with your own challenging 
#algorithm for other students to trace. 
#It must contain at least 5 if statements and 
#use at least one AND or OR boolean condition.

#For this challenge try reading 3 or 4 of your classmates' 
#codeâ€”trace the code and predict what it outputs, 
#then run it in the Sandbox to see if you got it right.
